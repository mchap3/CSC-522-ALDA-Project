"""
Final interface of code. Central place to view/run all experiments, run final optimized models, and summarize results.
Please note that the results observed may not match those reported, as many of the models are stochastic and generate
a spread of results. The results we reported were close to median performance for each model.

The default code produces outputs for each model with and without indicators and summarizes all of them into summary
tables/plots. To view our experiments, comment out the portion of the code that produces the result summaries (section
3), and uncomment individual functions from section 2 of this script.

Wish we could have made a better user interface, but that was beyond the scope of the project! Enjoy ^_^
